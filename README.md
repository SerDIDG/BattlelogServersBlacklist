Battlelog Servers Blacklist
=========================

Google Chrome Extension.

This extension allows you to create your own blacklist of banned Battlefield series servers.

Tired of stupid servers configuration; auto balance in inappropriate moment; no ability to move to larger / winning team; servers' admins; bans for no reason? Just add a server to your blacklist and you won't see it again anymore.

Supported games:
- Battlefield 3
- Battlefield 4
- Battlefield Hardline Beta
 
Future plans:
- Hide blocked servers from Server Browser.
- Display BSB status of server on which one's friend plays in Com Center.
- Preferences tab.
- MOHW support can be implemented with donation only.
